access to AWR related views
Would like to perform traces of applications/sessions

V$SQLAREA, V$SQL, or V$SQLSTATS, V$SQLTEXT, V$SQL_PLAN, V$SQL_PLAN_STATISTICS
V$SESSION_LONGOPS
V$SESSION

V$SYSTEM_EVENT 
	provides wait event statistics for the foreground activities of an instance and the wait event statistics for the instance as a whole. The V$SYSTEM_WAIT_CLASS view provides these wait event statistics (foreground and instance statistics) after aggregating to wait classes.

V$SESSION_EVENT and V$SYSTEM_WAIT_CLASS 
	provide wait event and wait class statistics at session level.
	
V$SESS_TIME_MODEL and V$SYS_TIME_MODEL 
	Time model statistics based on time usage for activities

	
V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY 
DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY 
	view provides sampled session activity in the instance
	Active Session History also contains execution plan information for each SQL statement that is captured.

DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT - The table holds AWR snapshots information for all snapshots.
DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT - The informaiton and statistics in this table are taken from V$SQL with each AWR snapshot, it chooses the top SQL statements from the dynamic view. The number of statements depends on the value of STATISTICS_LEVEL parameter.
DBA_HIST_SQL_PLAN - This table is pretty much the same as V$SQL_PLAN. the greatest thing about it is that it keeps execution plans of all statements and the informaiton is not purged when snapshots are deleted.
DBA_HIST_SQLTEXT - Same as DBA_HIST_SQL_PLAN but with V$SQL_TEXT.
DBA_HIST_SEG_STAT - Same as DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT but with V$SEGMENT_STATISTICS, the columns are slightly different from the V$, the HIST table has a column for each statistic instead of the STATISTIC_NAME column that the V$ has. This table also holds information of the top segments of each snapshot and the number is also controlled by the STATISTIC_LEVEL parameter.
DBA_HIST_SYSTEM_EVENT - The HIST of V$SYSTEM_EVENT, holds the wait events information for every snapshot.
DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY - The HIST table of V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY.
	
V$SYSSTAT and V$SESSTAT
	A large number of cumulative database statistics are available on a system and session level
	
select * from V$OSSTAT ;
	captures machine level information in the database	
	
V$IOSTAT_FILE
	I/O statistics of database files that are or have been accessed are captured in the 
	
V$IOSTAT_FUNCTION
	I/O statistics for database functions (such as the LGWR and DBWR) are captured in the 

V$IOSTAT_NETWORK
	set of network I/O statistics in the 

V$WAITSTAT 
	to see which block type has the highest wait count and the highest wait time	

V$FILESTAT
	This contains detailed file I/O statistics for each file, including the number of I/Os for each file and the average read time.

V$ROLLSTAT
	This contains detailed rollback and undo segment statistics for each segment.

V$ENQUEUE_STAT
	This contains detailed enqueue statistics for each enqueue, including the number of times an enqueue was requested and the number of times an enqueue was waited for, and the wait time.

V$LATCH
	This contains detailed latch usage statistics for each latch, including the number of times each latch was requested and the number of times the latch was waited for.

	
V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY
	The V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY view displays active database session activity, sampled once every second. See "Active Session History".

V$SESS_TIME_MODEL and V$SYS_TIME_MODEL
	The V$SESS_TIME_MODEL and V$SYS_TIME_MODEL views contain time model statistics, including DB time which is the total time spent in database calls

V$SESSION_WAIT
	The V$SESSION_WAIT view displays information about the current or last wait for each session (such as wait ID, class, and time).

V$SESSION
	The V$SESSION view displays information about each current session and contains the same wait statistics as those found in the V$SESSION_WAIT view. If applicable, this view also contains detailed information about the object that the session is currently waiting for (such as object number, block number, file number, and row number), the blocking session responsible for the current wait (such as the blocking session ID, status, and type), and the amount of time waited.

V$SESSION_EVENT
	The V$SESSION_EVENT view provides summary of all the events the session has waited for since it started.

V$SESSION_WAIT_CLASS
	The V$SESSION_WAIT_CLASS view provides the number of waits and the time spent in each class of wait events for each session.

V$SESSION_WAIT_HISTORY
	The V$SESSION_WAIT_HISTORY view displays information about the last ten wait events for each active session (such as event type and wait time).

V$SYSTEM_EVENT
	The V$SYSTEM_EVENT view provides a summary of all the event waits on the instance since it started.

V$EVENT_HISTOGRAM
	The V$EVENT_HISTOGRAM view displays a histogram of the number of waits, the maximum wait, and total wait time on an event basis.

V$FILE_HISTOGRAM
	The V$FILE_HISTOGRAM view displays a histogram of times waited during single block reads for each file.

V$SYSTEM_WAIT_CLASS
	The V$SYSTEM_WAIT_CLASS view provides the instance wide time totals for the number of waits and the time spent in each class of wait events.

V$TEMP_HISTOGRAM
	The V$TEMP_HISTOGRAM view displays a histogram of times waited during single block reads for each temporary file.	
	

	
	
DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY
