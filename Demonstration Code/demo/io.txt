                           Go 
                           by Jonathan Knudsen 
                     In school, they used to teach the three R's:
                     readin', ritin', and 'rithmatic. In this column, I'll
                     talk about reading and writing data in Java, on
                     the theory that "two out of three ain't bad." The
                     java.io package provides a rich suite of classes
             that encapsulate data streams. I'll take you on a quick
             fly-through of the concepts and classes in java.io,
             progressing from basic byte streams through filtered
             streams, object serialization, and the character-based
             streams of JDK 1.1.

             InputStream

             The InputStream class represents a stream of input bytes.
             You can read data from an InputStream using the
             read() method, which comes in three flavors. read()
             with no arguments returns the next byte in the stream. A
             special return value, -1, signifies that the end of the input
             stream has been reached. The other two overrides of
             read() fill up byte arrays with data from the input stream.
             They return the amount of data read, or -1 if there is no
             more data to read.

             One useful InputStream is FileInputStream, which
             represents a byte input stream constructed from a disk file.
             The following method shows how you could read an entire
             file, one byte at a time. Every byte read is fed to another
             method, processByte(), which is not shown here. When
             you're finished with a stream, it's a good idea to clean up by
             calling close(). This method releases any system
             resources that the stream is consuming. 

             public void readFileLaboriously(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileInputStream in = new
             FileInputStream(filename);
             int b;
             while ((b = in.read()) != -1)
             processByte(b);
             in.close();
             } 

             Here's a slightly different approach; we read the file in 8K
             blocks. The end result is the same; processByte() is
             called for every byte in the file. 

             public void readFileInBlocks(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(filename);
             byte[] chunk = new byte[8192];
             int length;
             while ((length = in.read(chunk)) != -1) {
             for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) 
             processByte(chunk[i]);
             }
             in.close();
             } 

             OutputStream

             The OutputStream class represents an output byte stream.
             It's just as easy to use as InputStream. You can write
             data to the stream using any of the overrides of write().
             In the following example, we use a FileOutputStream to
             write data to a file. As with input streams, it's a good idea to
             clean up when you're done with an OutputStream by
             calling close(). 

             Some streams use a concept called buffering to increase
             efficiency. This means that some of the data you ask to be
             written to the stream is held in memory. Later, a whole
             chunk of data is written to the physical device, usually a
             disk or a network connection. You can tell the stream to
             write out any buffered data with the flush() method.
             Closing the stream implies a call to flush(), but I've
             included an explicit call anyhow in the examples that follow.
             This is good practice, especially in network applications,
             where flush() is especially important. 

             public void writeOneToTen(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(filename);
             for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
             out.write(i);
             out.flush();
             out.close();
             } 

             One of the nice things about streams is that files and
             network connections work the same way. With minimal
             changes, we can make the previous example write data over
             a network socket. 

             public void writeOneToTen(String host, int port)
             throws IOException {
             Socket s = new Socket(host, port);
             OutputStream out = s.getOutputStream();
             for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
             out.write(i);
             out.flush();
             out.close();
             } 

             Filtered Streams

             One of the most powerful concepts in Java's stream I/O is
             filtered streams. A filtered stream acts just like a regular
             stream, except that it performs some additional processing
             on an underlying data stream. This concept will become
             clearer as we discuss some of the filtered streams that are
             provided in java.io: buffered streams, pushback streams,
             data streams, and object streams. 

             Buffering

             We mentioned data buffering earlier; it's usually used to
             increase the efficiency of a stream. Let's consider one
             example of buffering, the BufferedInputStream class.
             Let's re-write one of our InputStream examples to use
             buffering: 

             public void readFileWithBuffering(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(filename);
             BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(fileIn);
             int b;
             while ((b = in.read()) != -1)
             processByte(b);
             in.close();
             } 

             Notice how the BufferedInputStream is "wrapped"
             around the underlying stream, a FileInputStream. The
             first time we call read() on the buffered stream, it fills an
             internal buffer from the underlying FileInputStream.
             Subsequent calls to read() return data directly from the
             buffer, which is faster than reading the file again.

             In this example, we've used a default-sized buffer, but there
             are other BufferedInputStream constructors that let you
             specify whatever buffer size you want.

             There's a corresponding output stream class, called
             BufferedOutputStream. When you write data using
             write(), it accumulates the data in an internal buffer.
             When the buffer is full, the whole thing is written to the
             underlying stream. As we discussed, you can use flush()
             to force the contents of the buffer to be written to the
             underlying stream. 

             Pushback

             Another spiffy filtered stream is PushbackInputStream.
             This stream is useful in situations where an application
             needs to recognize a variety of file formats. Let's say you
             have a method for each file format your application
             recognizes. You might create a FileInputStream and
             pass it to each method. When one of them succeeds
             without throwing an exception, you've found the format of
             the file. However, you'd need to "rewind" the file stream
             between each method call so that each method started at the
             beginning of the stream. This is where
             PushbackInputStream comes in handy. If you discover
             that you are not reading the format you expected, you can
             "push back" any bytes you've read using the unread()
             method. Subsequent calls to the PushbackInputStream
             will return the pushed back data. 

             Data and Object Streams

             The java.io package includes useful filtered streams for
             reading and writing primitive types and objects.
             DataOutputStream, for example, includes a method for
             writing each primitive type. These are conveniently named
             writeInt(), writeDouble(), writeBoolean(), and
             so forth. Data written with a DataOutputStream can be
             read using a DataInputStream. This class has a
             corresponding set of methods named readInt(),
             readDouble(), readBoolean(), and so on. The
             following example shows a pair of methods that
             demonstrates use of the data streams. 

             public void writeData(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(filename);
             DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(fileOut);
             out.writeInt(9);
             out.writeDouble(Math.PI);
             out.writeBoolean(true);
             out.close();
             } 

             public void readData(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(filename);
             DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(fileIn);
             int i = in.readInt();
             double d = in.readDouble();
             boolean b = in.readBoolean();
             in.close();
             System.out.println("Read " + i + ", " + d + ", and " + b + ".");
             } 

             Object streams extend the concept of data streams by
             allowing you to read and write entire objects. This is called
             object serialization; it's a feature that was introduced in JDK
             1.1. On the surface, it's simple, but underneath, it can get
             pretty hairy. One of the big complications is that any
             objects referenced by an object must also be serialialized.
             So when you write an object, all objects it referenced also
             get written. There are also some tricky issues involving class
             resolution when objects are deserialized.

             When it works right, though, it's very simple. Here I present
             a pair of methods that write and read a java.awt.Color
             object. The relevant filtered stream classes are
             ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream. 

             public void writeColor(Color c, String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(filename);
             ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
             out.writeObject(c);
             out.close();
             } 

             public Color readColor(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream(filename);
             ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
             Color c = null;
             try { c = (Color)in.readObject(); } 
             catch (Exception e) { /* Handle exceptions. */ }
             in.close();
             return c;
             } 

             Note that the object returned by readObject() must be
             cast to the correct type. 

             Character Streams

             Thus far, we've talked exclusively about byte streams,
             which only account for a little more than half of the classes
             in java.io. The rest of the package provides support for
             Unicode character streams. The character stream classes
             are Reader and Writer, which are directly analagous to
             InputStream and OutputStream. There's also a
             corresponding set of filtered character streams, like
             BufferedReader, PushbackReader, and others.

             Reader, like InputStream, has a set of read() methods
             that are used to retrieve data from the stream. They just
             return characters and charaters arrays instead of bytes.
             Likewise, Writer has a set of write() methods that work
             just like the write() methods in OutputStream. 

             Bridge Classes

             Ultimately, devices are based on byte streams. A disk file,
             for example, is a stream of bytes. So how do you use the
             character stream classes with a file? You need a bridge
             between the world of character streams and the world of
             byte streams. There are two such bridge classes,
             InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter. An
             InputStreamReader acts like a Reader but wraps an
             underlying InputStream. Likewise, an
             OutputStreamWriter is a Writer that wraps around an
             OutputStream. These classes use an encoding scheme to
             convert between bytes and characters. Usually you can just
             use the default encoding scheme. In the following example,
             I use an OutputStreamWriter to write a Unicode string
             to a file. 

             public void writeString(String filename)
             throws IOException {
             FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(filename);
             OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(fileOut);
             String message = "This is a Unicode string.";
             out.write(message);
             out.close();
             } 

             How am I doing?

             Are these columns useful? Too easy? Too hard? Too
             boring? Too theoretical? What would you like to see in this
             space? Drop me an email at jonathan@oreilly.com; I'm
             interested to hear what you think. Specific comments are the
             most helpful.
