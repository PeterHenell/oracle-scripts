Hi guys,
Sorry, but this is a SQL question instead of PL/SQL.
I simply want to control the sorting of a very simple CONNECT BY query. For example (using
the SCOTT/TIGER table, EMP):

SELECT LPAD(' ',(LEVEL-1)*4,' ')||ENAME
FROM EMP
CONNECT BY MGR=PRIOR EMPNO
START WITH MGR = 7839

returns:

JONES
    SCOTT
        ADAMS
    FORD
        SMITH
BLAKE
    ALLEN
    WARD
    MARTIN
    TURNER
    JAMES
CLARK
    MILLER

Now, I want to sort based on ENAME, but leave the indentated names with their respective
manager. Like:

BLAKE
    ALLEN
    JAMES
    MARTIN
    TURNER
    WARD
CLARK
    MILLER
JONES
    FORD
        SMITH
    SCOTT
        ADAMS

Notice how JONES was move to the bottom and all the names within BLAKE where sorted as
well.

It this possible? If so how?
Thanks.

Hi Barry,

There are some ways to force the optimizer to use certain indexes and though the result set
will be sorted, but they are very unstable and unsure.
Well, there is another way. It uses an additional function. The general idea is to sort based on
the concatenated names upwards in the hierarchy.
Here is the code (sorry I didn't use the standard SCOTT schema, but this one is almost the
same - only the names of the objects are slightly different):
The code of the function:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION emp_order 
(v_employee_id employee.employee_id%TYPE
,v_level NUMBER) RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
l_s VARCHAR2(4000);
BEGIN
FOR c IN
(SELECT LAST_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
CONNECT BY PRIOR MANAGER_ID = EMPLOYEE_ID
START WITH EMPLOYEE_ID = v_employee_id
ORDER BY LEVEL)
LOOP
l_s := c.last_name || ',' || l_s;
END LOOP;
RETURN l_s;
END;

The code of the statement (I added the result the function returns in the result set):
SELECT LPAD(' ',(LEVEL-1)*4,' ')||LAST_NAME, emp_order(employee_id, LEVEL)
FROM EMPLOYEE
CONNECT BY MANAGER_ID=PRIOR EMPLOYEE_ID
START WITH MANAGER_ID = 7839
ORDER BY emp_order(employee_id, LEVEL)

Hope this helps!
Krasen

There is a method you can use to get hierarchical query results sorted on each level. I will use
Oracle's famous emp table. 

SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename 
org_chart, 
2 empno, mgr, job 
3 FROM emp 
4 START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT' 
5 CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr; 

ORG_CHART EMPNO MGR JOB 
-------------------- --------- --------- --------- 
KING 7839 PRESIDENT 
JONES 7566 7839 MANAGER 
SCOTT 7788 7566 ANALYST 
ADAMS 7876 7788 CLERK 
FORD 7902 7566 ANALYST 
SMITH 7369 7902 CLERK 
BLAKE 7698 7839 MANAGER 
ALLEN 7499 7698 SALESMAN 
WARD 7521 7698 SALESMAN 
MARTIN 7654 7698 SALESMAN 
TURNER 7844 7698 SALESMAN 
JAMES 7900 7698 CLERK 
CLARK 7782 7839 MANAGER 
MILLER 7934 7782 CLERK 

We want results ordered by ENAME on each level. Solution is based on the fact the above
query searches for all rows where column MGR has same value as current EMPNO. Therefore,
hierarchical query would use an index on MGR column if one would exist. If we will create an
index on two columns MGR and ENAME, we will have an ordered list of manager EMPNOs and for
each manager's EMPNO in that list we will have an ordered list of ENAMEs working for that
manager. As you can see, all we need is correct index: 

SQL> CREATE INDEX emp_mgr_ename ON emp(mgr,ename); 

Index created. 

SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename 
org_chart, 
2 empno, mgr, job 
3 FROM emp 
4 START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT' 
5 CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr; 

ORG_CHART EMPNO MGR JOB 
-------------------- --------- --------- --------- 
KING 7839 PRESIDENT 
BLAKE 7698 7839 MANAGER 
ALLEN 7499 7698 SALESMAN 
JAMES 7900 7698 CLERK 
MARTIN 7654 7698 SALESMAN 
TURNER 7844 7698 SALESMAN 
WARD 7521 7698 SALESMAN 
CLARK 7782 7839 MANAGER 
MILLER 7934 7782 CLERK 
JONES 7566 7839 MANAGER 
FORD 7902 7566 ANALYST 
SMITH 7369 7902 CLERK 
SCOTT 7788 7566 ANALYST 
ADAMS 7876 7788 CLERK 

If you want descending order, use INDEX_DESC hint: 

SQL> SELECT /*+ INDEX_DESC(emp,emp_mgr_ename) */ 
2 LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename org_chart, 
3 empno, mgr, job 
4 FROM emp 
5 START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT' 
6 CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr; 

ORG_CHART EMPNO MGR JOB 
-------------------- --------- --------- --------- 
KING 7839 PRESIDENT 
JONES 7566 7839 MANAGER 
SCOTT 7788 7566 ANALYST 
ADAMS 7876 7788 CLERK 
FORD 7902 7566 ANALYST 
SMITH 7369 7902 CLERK 
CLARK 7782 7839 MANAGER 
MILLER 7934 7782 CLERK 
BLAKE 7698 7839 MANAGER 
WARD 7521 7698 SALESMAN 
TURNER 7844 7698 SALESMAN

I have been dealing with hierarchical data for a number of years while supporting a complex
"parts list" application. I've had to both use and overcome the limitations of the Oracle
CONNECT BY query. The main limitations are the restrictions on connect by use with joins to
multiple tables, and the difficulties with achieving "in-level ordering". The join limitation can be
overcome somewhat with user function look up of data from other tables in the query. The
in-level ordering can sometimes be overcome with indexes or work around data retrieval
approaches. 

I agree with Krasen that the use of indexes to achieve in level ordering from a connect by
query is less than ideal. This method has the following limitations. The order is controlled by
the presence of a correctly indexed column or column set. This is a side effect of the presence
of an index and the retrieval methods of the database. The order produced is not specifiable
by the SQL query. In general the index is not under the control of the user issuing a query. Use
of an index provides only one single set of ordering columns. For example if emp(mgr, ename) is
indexed, then an attempt to order by (within level) sal or hire_date will not be possible without
dropping one index and creating a new different index. Also it is advisable to remove other
indexes that might be selected by the optimizer when doing the CONNECT BY. In the emp
example, drop any index on emp(mgr) when adding index on emp(mgr,ename). Ordering by this
method does not allow a more complex and flexible ordering by expressions and functions that
is possible in the general SQL order by clause. (I am not sure how 8i's
Function/Expression-based Indexes will improve the situation.) 

In criticizing index influenced in-level ordering use in general, it does provide a quick method of
achieving one predefined in-level ordering per table. I am glad that Solomon provided a good
example. This method does work if you only need one ordering (or two with descending order)
and the ordering requirements can be supported by indexing available columns (and possibly
with simple expressions in 8i). 

If you require more complex in-level ordering than can be provided by index influence, then the
data has to be retrieved by non-SQL SELECT means using other work arounds. Each of these
other means has it's own set of limitations. I have tried and continue to use a number of them
in specific cases. All are much less flexible and more complex than strait SQL.

Krasen's method of providing a ordering function is interesting. The function provides a
concatenated list of the parent records sort field. It solves the problem in this case but also
has its own unique limitations. The method involves querying for all the parent records for each
record retrieved. The repeated querying for parents for each record will have negative
performance impacts. The method is somewhat level limited by the length of the parent's
names and by the SQL varchar2 data type length - but this is probably not a significant
limitation in most cases. Each table and different sort order requires its own procedure, a
limitation shared by the other methods discussed here. It may also be difficult to implement
some other complex orderings by mixed data type columns and expressions. 

In PL/SQL, a recursive procedure can be used to retrieve the hierarchy with any desired
in-level order. The procedure uses a cursor for one level at a time with the required ordering.
Each record retrieved by the procedure causes the procedure to call itself again to - to find
and retrieve any lower records. Output can be produced by out mode PL/SQL table parameter,
by UTL_FILE, by dbms_output or to an Oracle table or temp table. This method uses the same
code for all levels and avoids any level limitations but other problems remain. A separate
procedure is required for each table and ordering. A separate procedure or hard coded
modifications and recompiles are necessary to change the ordering. Flexibility is far short of the
standard SQL connect by query.

A derived sort order can also be pre-stored in the table. I do this in parts lists where changes
are somewhat infrequent and one predefined but complex in-level ordering is required. I have
table triggers that execute on DML events which effect in-level ordering. The triggers call
stored procedures that determine the sort order and explicitly store an integer from 1 to n in a
column added for this purpose. The connect by pseudo column LEVEL is also stored in the table
to support indented listings. This method involves updating ALL the records in a part list each
time that one record changes in a way that effects ordering. Obviously only one fixed sort is
stored. The sort and level columns can be used for easy indented hierarchical ordering of the
complete parts list later. This is important when I have to export data for off-line simplified
processing by non-oracle databases that do not have CONNECT BY.

In reports, each level can be queried with its own query that has the desired ordering. This
requires a master-detail-detail-detail… for all anticipated levels. Problems and limitations of this
method are significant. This approach hard codes the maximum extracted hierarchy level in the
report. This method requires a duplicate query, group layout etc. at each level. This method is
difficult to develop and maintain, as everything must be duplicated to each level's query, group
and layout. Custom reports are required for each query to different tables. Different sorts
might be accommodated by lexical parameters to provide a common, changeable or dynamic
sort clause for each level query. 

In general I recommend the following, presented in order of greatly increasing difficulty:

1. If an index can be added that will achieve the (single) ordering required, then use the index
influenced CONNECT BY method. It is not explicit but it works and it is easy to implement. 

2. If indexes are not available and performance is acceptable then try Karsen's function
approach.

3. If the data has low volatility, and you are good with packages and table triggers, you might
possibly consider storing the sort order in the table.

The other methods are probably more effort then they are worth unless your requirements
force you to these extreme measures.

Mark

Mark,
the solution I provided is quite stable. I used it
many times. I agree, index solution is implementation
based and if index is deleted or optimizer decides
not to use it, query will stop working as expected.
Therefore index solution requires additional index
management. If same hierarchy needs to be ordered by
different columns you would have to create bunch of
different indexes and having multiple indexes could
result in performance issues (I mean inserts/updates/deletes).
There is another solution. I believe I posted it
a year or so ago. It is, essentially, the same solution
Krasen came up with, but does not have that overhead of
"querying for all the parent records for each record
retrieved". Such querying is completely unnecessary
since Oracle already selects rows in hierarchical
order. All we need is a PL/SQL table to store order
by expression for each current level. Unfortunately, I could
not find the posting, so I recreated PL/SQL package from
scratch:

CREATE OR REPLACE
 PACKAGE Hierarchy
  IS
        TYPE BranchTableType IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(4000)
          INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
        BranchTable BranchTableType;
        FUNCTION Branch(vLevel          IN NUMBER,
                        vValue          IN VARCHAR2,
                        vDelimiter      IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT CHR(0))
                        RETURN VARCHAR2;
        PRAGMA RESTRICT_REFERENCES(Branch,WNDS);
END Hierarchy;
/
CREATE OR REPLACE
 PACKAGE BODY Hierarchy
  IS
        ReturnValue VARCHAR2(4000);
  FUNCTION Branch(vLevel        IN NUMBER,
                  vValue        IN VARCHAR2,
                  vDelimiter    IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT CHR(0))
                  RETURN VARCHAR2
   IS
   BEGIN
        BranchTable(vLevel) := vValue;
        ReturnValue := vValue;
        FOR I IN REVERSE 1..vLevel - 1 LOOP
          ReturnValue := BranchTable(I)|| vDelimiter || ReturnValue;
        END LOOP;
        RETURN ReturnValue;
  END Branch;
END Hierarchy;
/

Now, if we want to order emp table ny employee name, we use:

SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename org_chart,
  2   Hierarchy.Branch(level,ename) branch,
  3   job
  4    FROM  empX
  5    START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT'
  6    CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
  7*   ORDER BY branch
SQL> /

ORG_CHART            BRANCH                                   JOB

KING                 KING                                     PRESIDENT

    ALLEN            KING BLAKE ALLEN                         SALESMAN

  CLARK              KING CLARK                               MANAGER
    MILLER           KING CLARK MILLER                        CLERK
  JONES              KING JONES                               MANAGER
    FORD             KING JONES FORD                          ANALYST
      SMITH          KING JONES FORD SMITH                    CLERK

      ADAMS          KING JONES SCOTT ADAMS                   CLERK

14 rows selected.


Note, that function Hierarchy.Branch modifies package
state since PL/SQL table BranchTable is global and
can not be used in ORDER BY clause. We need to "trick"
Oracle by moving order by expression into select list
and ordering my that select list column. This way order
by expression is calculated at select list creation time
rather than at order by time. Otherwise we would get:

SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename org_chart,
  2     job
  3    FROM  empX
  4    START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT'
  5    CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
  6*   ORDER BY Hierarchy.Branch(level,ename)
SQL> /
  ORDER BY Hierarchy.Branch(level,ename)
           *
ERROR at line 6:
ORA-06573: Function BRANCH modifies package state, cannot be used here

We can hide column brach by setting it to NOPRINT.
One more thing. The above solution (same as Krasen's solution), in general,
will not work. Assume we have two Blakes working for King and each of Blakes has Allen working
for him. Then:

SQL> SELECT LPAD(' ',2*(LEVEL-1)) || ename org_chart,
  2   Hierarchy.Branch(level,ename) branch,
  3   job
  4    FROM  empX
  5    START WITH job = 'PRESIDENT'
  6    CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
  7    ORDER BY branch
  8  /

As you can see, we are trading index dependency for
data dependency. And, as you pointed out, concatenation of
parent values is limited to 4000 bytes and might be not
enough if hierarchy is very deep and/or parent values
are too long.
