<P>This document provides information on how to use the table encapsulator package named te_emp. This
package allows you to perform all SQL-related actions against the table, EMP, through a PL/SQL interface
or API (application programmatic interface).</P>
<P>Instead of writing an UPDATE SQL statement in your program, for example, you would call the te_emp.upd
procedure. Instead of writing a SELECT statement to retrieve a row from EMP for a specific primary key, you
would call the te_emp.onerow function. Why bother with these programs? Why not simply
access the table directly? By using the table encapsulator package, you will achieve a higher level of performance
in your application, it will be easier to maintain your code, and you will be able to write your code faster.</P>
<P>The documentation for the API is broken out into the following categories:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Data Structure Types - TYPE statements declaring data structures (mostly record TYPES) which you will use to
	declare records in your programs.
	<LI>Cursors - pre-defined cursors which retrieve rows of information from EMP. As a rule, you should never
	write your own cursors against EMP. Check instead the set of cursors already created for you in te_emp.
	If the query you need is not present, contact your program administrator to enhance the package.
	<LI>Cursor Management - procedures to open and close the cursors. You should use these programs rather than issuing
	your own OPEN and CLOSE statements, because they have additional features built into them.
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI>Retrieval Programs - a set of functions that you can use to retrieve data from the table for specific primary
	key and foreign key values.
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI>Row Count Programs - a set of functions that return the number of rows in the table, the entire table, for
	a specific primary key, and for foreign key values.
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI>Insert Programs - one or more procedures to execute an INSERT statement to add rows to EMP.
	<LI>Update Programs - one or more procedures to execute an UDPATE statement to modify rows in EMP.
	<LI>Delete Programs - one or more procedures to execute an DELETE statement to remove rows from EMP.
</UL>


<UL>
	<LI>Memory Management - you can use the pinme procedure to pin the package into shared memory, making sure the
	code is always available when needed.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="tips"></A><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial">Tips and Usage Notes</FONT></H1>
<P>1. Referencing Elements of Package: Unless otherwise noted, whenever you use a code element defined in te_emp,
you must preface that element with &quot;te_emp.&quot;, as in:</P>
<PRE>te_emp.ins (...);</PRE>
<P>2. Avoiding System-Assigned Database Object Names: You may encounter package elements with names like &quot;SYS_C00642&quot;.
This will occur when table constraints (including primary keys, foreign keys and check constraints) are not given
names at the time they are created. Instead, Oracle assigns a name using a sequential number. Obviously, this is
not very readable code. There are two ways to get around these undesirable names: ask the DBA to provide informative
names along with the constraint creation statements or use the PL/Generator aliasing feature (Coding Standards
screen) to provide names for these constraints which will impact only the generated code.</P>
<P>The first approach, changing the name of the constraint in the database, is the recommended approach.</P>
<P>3. Choosing Between Overloaded Programs: Many of the programs in this package are overloaded. That means that
there are more than one program with the same name. In most cases, the difference between these overloadings is
that one program relies on passing individual, scalar values as arguments, while others allow you to pass record
structures.</P>
<P>Whenever possible, you should rely on parameter lists that pass records, instead of individual values. It is
quite likely that your table structure will change over time, and with the table encapsulator package. If you always
work with records, you will keep to an absolute minimum the number of programs already relying on the package's
API which have to be fixed.</P>

<P>This section documents the PL/SQL TYPE statements declaring data structures (mostly record TYPES) which you
will use to declare records in your programs.</P>
<P>The te_emp.pky_rt record TYPE defines a record structure for the primary key of EMP.
This record TYPE is used in various programs in the package, including isnullpky and del.</P>
<PRE>   TYPE te_emp.pky_rt IS RECORD (
      EMPNO EMP.EMPNO%TYPE,

      );</PRE>
<P>Here is an example of using the primary key record TYPE:</P>
<PRE>DECLARE

<P><A NAME="Cursors"></A><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><B>Cursors</B></FONT></P>
<P>This section documents the pre-defined cursors that retrieve rows of information from EMP. As a rule,
you should never write your own cursors against EMP. Check instead the set of cursors already created for
you in te_emp. If the query you need is not present, contact your program administrator to enhance
the package. If you take this approach, you will improve the performance of your application by increasing the
usage of pre-parsed cursors in the SGA. You will also make it much easier to maintain the application code as the
underlying table changes.</P>
<P>The te_emp.allbypky_cur cursor returns the specified columns for all rows, ordered by the
primary key. Here is the definition of that cursor:</P>
<PRE>   CURSOR te_emp.allbypky_cur
   IS
      SELECT *
        FROM EMP
       ORDER BY
         EMPNO
      ;
</PRE>
<P>The te_emp.allforpky_cur cursor returns the specified columns for a single row identified
by the primary key. Here is the definition of that cursor:</P>

      )
   IS
      SELECT *
        FROM EMP
       WHERE
         EMPNO = empno_in
      ;
</PRE>
<P>The te_emp.fk_deptno_all_cur cursor returns the specified columns for a all rows identified by the
foreign key, fk_deptno. Here is the definition of that cursor:</P>

</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><B>Cursor Management</B></FONT></P>
<P>This package not only provides you with pre-built cursors, but also offers a set of open and close procedures
to make it easier for you to work with the cursors. As you will see below, these programs offer some special features
you are unlikely to code yourself, so you will be much better off relying on the te_emp open and close
procedures instead of issuing explicit OPEN and CLOSE statements yourself.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Open Cursors</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>Each cursor defined in the package has a corresponding open procedure. Each of these procedures has a final
close_if_open parameter. This parameter controls the behavior of the open request in cases when the cursor is already
open (packaged cursors stay open until you close them explicitly. This is different behavior from locally declared
cursors, which close automatically when the block in which they were declared terminates).</P>
<P>If you pass TRUE for this parameter (the default), then the procedure will close the cursor if it is already
open. If you pass FALSE, then the request to open the cursor is <I>ignored</I> if the cursor is already open. Why
would you pass FALSE for close_if_open? Your application might be architected so that a particular cursor stays
open across multiple program calls, allowing you to fetch additional rows from any one of those programs. In this
case, you will want to make sure the cursor is open before you fetch, but you will not want any of the programs
to close the cursor prematurely.</P>
<P>The te_emp.open_allbypky_cur closes the te_emp.allbypky_cur cursor
documented in the previous section.</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.open_allbypky_cur (

<P>The programs in this section can be used to validate data associated with EMP. These validations may be
used to confirm the presence of a primary key and check for record equality. If there arecheck constraints stored
in the database for this table, you will also find functions that validate (mirror) those constraints for values
you pass to it.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Check for Non-NULL Primary Key</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>Use the isnullpky function to check easily that all columns in the primary key are not NULL. You
can use this function to validate that the primary key or the row returned by a call to a function is valid.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Record Equality Checks</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>PL/SQL does not allow you to perform a record-level comparison of two records for equality. This package, however,
contains two functions - overloaded as te_emp.recseq - which emulate record-level equality checks.</P>
<P>You can provide as an argument a records of the following type(s) to the te_emp.recseq function:</P>
<P>A record defined with EMP%ROWTYPE</P>

<UL>
	<LI>A record defined with te_emp.pky_rt

<H2>Count of All Rows</H2>
<P>The te_emp.rowcount function returns the count of all rows in the table. The header
is:</P>
<PRE>   FUNCTION te_emp.rowcount RETURN INTEGER;</PRE>
<P>Here is an example of using this function:</P>

</PRE>
<H2>Count of Rows for a Primary Key</H2>
<P>The te_emp.pkyrowcount function returns the number of rows in the table for a given

<P>You can use this function to determine if a row exists in the table for a primary key. You can also determine
if there is a data integrity issue -- this function should return 0 if the primary is not present and 1 if it is.
If it returns a number greater than 1, you may have a problem. Here is an example of how you might use this function:</P>

<H2><A NAME="Insert Programs"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Insert Programs</FONT></H2>
<P>Instead of issuing INSERT statements directly in your code, you will call the te_emp.ins
procedure. This procedure performs error handling and can even convert an INSERT into an UPDATE when it encounters
a DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX error (if, in other words, the primary key is already present in the database).</P>
<H3><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial">Record Initialization</FONT></H3>
<P>You can perform an insert by passing individual column values or by providing a table-based record. If you use
a record, you may want to call a record initialization program to assign the default values for each column to
the field in the record.</P>
<P>You can initialize a record with a function or a procedure as shown in the headers below:</P>
<PRE>   FUNCTION te_emp.initrec
      (allnull IN BOOLEAN := FALSE) RETURN EMP%ROWTYPE;

   PROCEDURE te_emp. initrec  (
      rec_inout IN OUT EMP%ROWTYPE,
      allnull IN BOOLEAN := FALSE);
</PRE>
<P>If you pass TRUE for the allnull argument, then all the fields in the record will be set to NULL. Otherwise,
the fields will be set to the default values for each column as specified in the table definition (NULL, unless
overridden with another default value).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Insert Procedures</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>This package provides more than one procedure with which to insert a row of data.</P>
</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Insert Providing Primary Key and Individual Fields</B></FONT></P>
<P>This version of ins requires that you pass not only the non-primary key column values, but also
a previously-generated or acquired primary key value (or values, in the case of multiple primary key columns).</P>
<P>The upd_on_dup argument controls the behavior of ins when the attempt to INSERT raises
a DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX error. This error occurs when a row already exists in the table with the same unique index column
values as the row being inserted.</P>
<P>If you pass FALSE for this argument (the default), then ins passes the DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX exception
back to the calling program (or sets the errnum argument if you are using return code exception handling).</P>
<P>If you pass TRUE for upd_on_dup, then if the INSERT fails with that error, the procedure will attempt
to perform an update for the row identified by the primary key by calling upd.</P>
<P>So if the DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX error is caused by a non-primary key unique index, this feature will not operate
properly.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Insert with Record, Providing Primary Key</B></FONT></P>
<P>In this version of ins you provide a table-based record (defined using EMP%ROWTYPE);
all fields, including those corresponding to the primary key are used in the insert action. This ins

<P>If you want the insert to take advantage of default column values as found in the table definition, you should
call te_emp.initrec or te_emp.initrec.</P>

a DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX error. This error occurs when a row already exists in the table with the same unique index column

<P><A NAME="Update Programs"></A><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><B>Update Programs</B></FONT></P>
<P>Updating through the package API can be a bit more complex than performing an insert or a delete. This package
provides a single upd procedure through which you can update all, some or just one column in a table's
row for a specific primary key.</P>
<P>The way such a general update procedure works is as follows:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>You do not have to pass a value for each column. Instead, you provide a value only for those columns whose
	values you want to change. You are likely to use named notation to single out those columns. This technique is
	shown in the adjoining examples.
	<P>
	<LI>By default, if you pass a NULL value for a column, then upd assumes that you do not want to
	update that column. In this case, the column value is set to its current value.
	<P>
	<LI>If you really do want to set a nullable column to a NULL value, then you will call the &quot;force function&quot;
	for that column, <I>forcing</I> the assignment of the NULL value. These force functions are explained below in
	more detail.
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Impact on Triggers</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>Since the general update procedure will update all non-primary key columns in the table, regardless of whether
or not the value has changed, you should make sure that all of your UPDATE triggers employ the WHEN clause. This
clause will allow you to specify that processing of the trigger only takes place when the value is changed.</P>
<P>If you do not want to have to insert this code into your triggers, then you should use single-column update
procedures (which can be generated as a part of this package). Contact your PL/Generator Designer to take this
action).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Forcing NULL Values in Update</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>This package contains a PL/SQL record structure that keeps track of the update-if-NULL status of each column
of the table. It is, in essence, a set of flags. By default, this record says to the update procedure: ignore this
value if it is NULL. You can change individual flags in this record to say &quot;set the column to NULL&quot; or,
in other words, &quot;I really mean it. I want to make this column value NULL&quot; by calling a force function.</P>
<P>Here are the headers of the force functions for each column:</P>
<PRE>   FUNCTION te_emp.ename$frc
      (ename_in IN EMP.ENAME%TYPE DEFAULT NULL)
      RETURN EMP.ENAME%TYPE;
</PRE>
<PRE>   FUNCTION te_emp.job$frc
      (job_in IN EMP.JOB%TYPE DEFAULT NULL)
      RETURN EMP.JOB%TYPE;

</PRE>
<PRE>   FUNCTION te_emp.deptno$frc
      (deptno_in IN EMP.DEPTNO%TYPE DEFAULT NULL)
      RETURN EMP.DEPTNO%TYPE;
</PRE>
<P>When you call this function it does two things:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Returns the value you pass into it, the default being NULL.
	<LI>Sets the force flag for that column to &quot;Yes, update if NULL&quot;.
</OL>

<P>The consequence is that when you then call te_emp.upd and pass a NULL value for that
column, its value will be set to NULL (and not ignored).</P>
<P>You can use these functions in one of two ways:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Assignment statement: a &quot;stand-alone&quot; call to the function, returning the value to a PL/SQL variable
	of the appropriate type.
	<LI>In-line execution: call the function within a call to the upd procedure, forcing the update
	of that column to NULL. This will be the way that you most commonly deploy the force functions.
</OL>

<P>The following example shows the use of the force function to set every non-primary key column to NULL in the
update. This will, of course, cause a failure in the update if any of the columns are defined to be NOT NULL.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Resetting the Force Flags</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>You can reset all of the force flags to &quot;don't update if NULL&quot; by calling the following procedure:</P>
<PRE>PROCEDURE te_emp.reset$frc;
</PRE>
<P>Note: this program is called by upd automatically if you pass TRUE (the default value) for the
reset_in argument.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Update Any/All Column Procedures</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>You perform an update on one row at a time, identified by the primary key. You can pass the values of the columns
you want to update either through individual parameters (one parameter per column) or through a record of type
EMP%ROWTYPE.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Update by Primary Key, using Individual Fields</B></FONT></P>
<P>When you call upd, you must provide a value for each column in the primary key. You can then
pass a value for each column you wish to update. The remaining arguments for upd are described after
the header.</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.upd (
      empno_in IN EMP.EMPNO%TYPE,
      ename_in IN EMP.ENAME%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      job_in IN EMP.JOB%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      mgr_in IN EMP.MGR%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      hiredate_in IN EMP.HIREDATE%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      sal_in IN EMP.SAL%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      comm_in IN EMP.COMM%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      deptno_in IN EMP.DEPTNO%TYPE DEFAULT NULL,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER,
      reset_in IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
      );
</PRE>
<P>The rowcount_out argument contains the number of rows updated by your request.</P>
<P>The reset_in argument controls the resetting of the force record. If TRUE, the default, then the force
record is reset to its initial values (meaning, a NULL value is ignored). If FALSE, then the force record is not
reset. The same columns for which a NULL value was applied in the current UPDATE will be &quot;marked&quot; for
update-if-NULL in the next call to te_emp.upd.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Update by Primary Key, using Record</B></FONT></P>
<P>This version of upd allows you to pass your column values for update through a record of type
EMP%ROWTYPE. The fields corresponding to primary key columns must be filled. All other fields can be assigned
values as is appropriate to the update you want to perform. The remaining arguments for upd are
described after the header.</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.upd (rec_in IN EMP%ROWTYPE,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER,
      reset_in IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE);
</PRE>
<P>The rowcount_out argument contains the number of rows updated by your request. This argument should return
either 0 or 1.</P>
<P>The reset_in argument controls the resetting of the force record. If TRUE, the default, then the force
record is reset to its initial values (meaning, a NULL value is ignored). If FALSE, then the force record is not
reset. The same columns for which a NULL value was applied in the current UPDATE will be &quot;marked&quot; for
update-if-NULL in the next call to te_emp.upd.</P>
</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Update Individual Columns</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>This package contains one or more procedures you can use to update individual columns for a specific primary
key without having to call the general update procedure. You may want to do this to avoid the overhead of updating
each column (even if it is updated to the same value) and initiating unnecessary trigger activity.</P>
<P>There are two versions of the single-column update for each specified column: one which accepts the primary
key as individual columns and another which allows you to pass the primary key as a PL/SQL record.</P>

<P><A NAME="Delete Programs"></A><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><B>Delete Programs</B></FONT></P>
<P>Rather than issuing an explicit DELETE in your programs, you will call te_emp.del.
You can delete the single row associated with a primary key, or you can delete all rows associated with a foreign
key value.</P>
<P>This package does not perform any kind of special logic or processing for cascading deletes, foreign key dependencies,
or other possible complications of delete operations.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Delete by Primary Key using Individual Fields</B></FONT></P>
<P>With this delete procedure, you provide the values of the primary key in individual arguments.</P>
<P>The rowcount_out returns the numbers of rows affected by the delete request (either 0 or 1, since it is a
primary key-based operation).</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.del (
      empno_in IN EMP.EMPNO%TYPE,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER);
</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Delete by Primary Key using Record</B></FONT></P>
<P>With this delete procedure, you provide the values of the primary key in a record of type te_emp.pky_rt.</P>
<P>The rowcount_out returns the numbers of rows affected by the delete request (either 0 or 1, since it is a
primary key-based operation).</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.del (rec_in IN pky_rt,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER);
</PRE>
<P>You can also request a delete of a row by passing a record of type EMP%ROWTYPE, which contains more
than just the primary key columns. Here is the header for this version of del:</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE del (rec_in IN EMP%ROWTYPE,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER);
</PRE>
<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial"><B>Delete by Foreign Key FK_DEPTNO</B></FONT></P>
<P>With this delete procedure, you delete all the rows in the table associated with a specific foreign key value.
You provide the values of the different columns in the foreign as individual arguments.</P>
<P>The rowcount_out returns the numbers of rows affected by the delete request (this number is <I>not</I> restricted
to 0 or 1, since it is a foreign key-based operation).</P>
<PRE>   PROCEDURE te_emp.delby_fk_deptno (
      deptno_in IN EMP.DEPTNO%TYPE,
      rowcount_out OUT INTEGER
      );
</PRE>

<P><A NAME="Performance Enhancers"></A><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><B>Performance Enhancers</B></FONT></P>
<P>This package contains one or more features that you may find useful in enhancing the performance of your database
access.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Arial"><I><B>Pinning te_emp in Shared Memory</B></I></FONT></P>
<P>If you want to make sure that programs in this package are instantly available for execution, you can &quot;pin&quot;
the package into shared memory. If you pin a package, it will not be a candidate for removal by the least-recently-used
(LRU) algorithm employed by Oracle to manage its shared memory area.</P>
<P>You will usually pin programs when the database is first initialized. That offers the best guarantee that sufficient
contiguous memory is found for your code.</P>
<P>There are two steps you will need to take to pin your package:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Call DBMS_SHARED_POOL.KEEP to &quot;register&quot; your package as a pinnable package.
	<LI>Reference an element in te_emp so that the package will be loaded into memory.
</OL>

<P>Here is the code you will need to run to enable pinning of te_emp:</P>
<PRE>   DBMS_SHARED_POOL.KEEP ('schemaname.te_emp');
</PRE>
<P>where schemaname is the name of the schema which owns te_emp.</P>
<P>Here is the code you will run after calling the KEEP built-in to load your package into memory:</P>
<PRE>te_emp.pinme;
</PRE>
<P>Both of these lines of code should be placed in an initialization script that is run when the database is started.
This is a job for your Database Administrator.</P>
